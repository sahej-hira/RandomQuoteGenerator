This is a project that gives a random quote from a collection of books (I've read). As for the styling, The application changes background color and the color of the text whilst displaying a new quote when the button is clicked.
Additional functionality includes, the quotes, its author and the book the quote is from can be shared on socail media namely Twitter and Tumblr.

Initially, I made this project to help my friend pick up the next they want to read. Although, after the development I came to find it usedul when one just needs soem words of wisdom, and a bunch.
